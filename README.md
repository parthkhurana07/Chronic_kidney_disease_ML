# Predictive Analysis of Chronic Kidney Disease

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the presence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using various clinical and demographic features. CKD is a condition characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function over time and can lead to serious health problems if not detected early. The dataset includes various parameters such as blood pressure, serum creatinine, hemoglobin levels, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 400 entries, each representing a patient's clinical record for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) prediction. There are a total of 25 columns in the dataset, encompassing both numerical and categorical data types, which include clinical parameters and health indicators relevant to the diagnosis of CKD.


## Methods
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding patterns and trends in the dataset.
3. Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant variables for the classification task.
4. Model Development: Building and training classification models.
5. Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models.

## Technologies Used
1. Jupyter Notebook (Python)
2. Libraries Used- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
